I like the idea of a trait that you pull in that has preset margin and padding values.
I remember someone had a css framework that had mathematically calculated margins and it looked very nice.
I literally cannot find it though.

```rs
use softui::Spacing;

rect().margin_s()
rect().margin_m()
rect().margin_l()
rect().margin_xl()
```
